## Guidelines

Use only HTML5. No CSS or JavaScript is required at this stage. Focus on using meaningful semantic elements to structure your page. Avoid using `<div>` or `<span>` unless absolutely necessary. Ensure your page has clearly defined sections such as a header, navigation, main content, and a footer.

Incorporate accessibility by using proper HTML5 landmarks and attributes that improve navigation for assistive technologies. Your HTML should reflect thoughtful planning of hierarchy and readability, both for users and search engines.

For SEO, emphasize the use of heading tags in the correct order, provide descriptive text, and ensure your content is both human-readable and crawler-friendly. Consider how a search engine would interpret your page in terms of structure and content clarity.

## Deliverables

A single HTML file named `index.html`. It should include:

* A semantic structure using appropriate HTML5 elements.
* Clear headings in a logical hierarchy.
* Accessibility enhancements using proper tags and attributes.
* SEO-friendly metadata and content.

## Tips

* Use HTML5 semantic tags appropriately.
* Organize content with accessibility in mind.
* Apply basic on-page SEO techniques.
* Follow clean, readable HTML code structure.
